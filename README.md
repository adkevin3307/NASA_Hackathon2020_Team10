## Introduction
Many previous research work has shown the effeciency of Few-shot learning when lacking of labeled data.
In our challenge, `biodiversity exploration for rare species`, we are facing the dilemma which is similar to Few-shot learning setting.
Therefore Few-shot Learning strategy may classify more precise among common species and rare one than naïve classification methods.
- To evaluate this speculate, we have done several experiments to show the advantages of Few-shot learning.
- In order to improve the performance when implementing on edge devices, we also show the model compression work we have done.
